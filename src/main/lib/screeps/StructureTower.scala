  * Remotely attacks or heals creeps, or repairs structures. Can be targeted to any object in the room.

  * 1-2	—
  * 3-4	1 tower
  * 5-6	2 towers
  * 7	3 towers
  * 8	6 towers

  * Cost	5,000
  * Hits	3,000
  * Capacity	1,000
  * Energy per action	10

  * Attack effectiveness	600 hits at range ≤5 to 150 hits at range ≥20
  * Heal effectiveness	400 hits at range ≤5 to 100 hits at range ≥20
  * Repair effectiveness	800 hits at range ≤5 to 200 hits at range ≥20
