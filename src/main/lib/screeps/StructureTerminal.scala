/**
  * Sends any resources to a Terminal in another room. The destination Terminal can belong to any
  * player. If its storage is full, the resources are dropped on the ground. Each transaction
  * requires additional energy (regardless of the transfer resource type) according to this
  * formula: ceil(0.1 * amount * linearDistanceBetweenRooms). For example, sending 100 mineral
  * units from W1N1 to W2N3 will consume 20 energy units. You can track your incoming and outgoing
  * transactions and estimate range cost between rooms using the Game.market object. Only one
  * Terminal per room is allowed that can be addressed by Room.terminal property.
  *
  * Required Controller Level - At least 6
  * Cost	                    - 100,000
  * Hits	                    - 3,0000
  * Capacity	                - 300,000
