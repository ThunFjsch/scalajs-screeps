    *             ignore array - An array of the room's objects or RoomPosition objects which should be treated as walkable tiles during the search. This option cannot be used when the new PathFinder is enabled (use costCallback option instead).
    *             avoid array - An array of the room's objects or RoomPosition objects which should be treated as obstacles during the search. This option cannot be used when the new PathFinder is enabled (use costCallback option instead).
    *             maxOps number - The maximum limit of possible pathfinding operations. You can limit CPU time used for the search based on ratio 1 op ~ 0.001 CPU. The default value is 2000.
    *             heuristicWeight number - Weight to apply to the heuristic in the A* formula F = G + weight * H. Use this option only if you understand the underlying A* algorithm mechanics! The default value is 1.2.
    *             serialize boolean - If true, the result path will be serialized using Room.serializePath. The default is false.
    *             maxRooms number - The maximum allowed rooms to search. The default (and maximum) is 16. This is only used when the new PathFinder is enabled.
